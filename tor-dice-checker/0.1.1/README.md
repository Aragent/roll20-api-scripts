These are updated API as of 8/26/2018 for the One Ring Based on Michael Heilemann work.
unfortunately when I started to set up TOR in roll 20 a lot of the The One Ring API's were broken some were simple line fixs others a little more to help others I have added my fixs
I also want to thank The Arron for his help.
