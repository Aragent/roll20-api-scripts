  "description": "Checks to see if a character's endurance drops below her fatigue, and automatically sets the `weary` attribute to `weary` or `normal`, \r\rSets a half-heart marker on the tokens of wounded/treated wound characters, mostly to serve as a reminder.",\r\rSets a marker on the tokens of miserable characters. Also automatically detects if a character is turning miserable if hope is less or equal total_shadow. However it does not reset miserable. This is on purpose not to override any temporary miserable state.
